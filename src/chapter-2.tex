The execution plan deliberately refrains from specifying exact implementation details, instead it tries to explore
possibilities rather than fixed pathways.\ This flexibility is essential because the implementation details will vary
depending on the allocated budget.
\\
The computer science team does not require much funding, if any.\ All the funding is for the systems administration team
which will acquire various hardware required to set up the operations detailed in the preceding chapter.

\section{Considerations \& Assumptions}\label{sec:considerations-&-assumptions}
This section describes a few critical considerations that the university should carefully contemplate to avoid
developing unrealistic expectations from the club, the proposal also bases some assumptions upon these considerations
to reduce initial costs.\ These are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CSSAC is not a one-time investment, it has running costs and so an annual budget is to be expected.
    \item Servers consume considerable amounts of electrical power, the proposed servers assume that university receives
    subsidized electricity at cheap rates and also produces a portion of its electrical power through solar energy.\\
    Another assumption has been made about the power reliability on the campus, a runtime of not more than 2--4 minutes
    is to be expected from the proposed UPS solutions.\ If the university is equipped with generators, they should start
    delivering power within this time-frame.
\end{itemize}

\section{Server Recommendations}\label{sec:server-recommendations}
I would highly recommend starting with a minimum of 2 physical nodes, or a server paired with a dedicated firewall
device, but a secondary server would be my preferred choice.\ This is to ensure that the network is physically
isolated from the server hosting services and events such as reboots do not take down the network, and in this case,
the path offering convenience also enhances security.\ HP servers are to be avoided due to them requiring an active
subscription to receive firmware updates, this is highly unethical and incentivizes running potentially insecure
software.\ And so, several Dell servers have been shortlisted:

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Dell Poweredge R820}\label{subsec:dell-poweredge-r820}
This is a 12th generation server from the poweredge series, offering 4 CPU sockets which could support upto 48 cores
and 96 threads, and it supports upto 1.5TB of DDR3 RAM\@.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Dell Poweredge R730}\label{subsec:dell-poweredge-r730}
This is a 13th generation server, offering 2 CPU sockets which could support upto 44 cores and 88 threads, but it
supports newer generation processors as compared to the R820.\ It also supports faster and more efficient DDR4 memory.
The R730 while marginally more expensive than the R820, it is a sweet spot between expensive newer generation servers
and cheaper older generation servers.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Dell Poweredge R620}\label{subsec:dell-poweredge-r710}
This is a 12th generation server which could be used as a secondary server to virtualize the firewall.

\section{Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}
If the proposal is accepted, the club has the following requirements from the university:

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Room Allotment}\label{subsec:room-allotment}

\subsubsection{Server Room}
When selecting a server room, several critical factors must be accounted for.\ The chosen room shall have proper
equipment to control temperature and humidity, too much humidity will cause condensation and too little will promote
electrostatic discharge.\ Ideally, the room shall not have any windows (or the windows should be covered) or be located
nearby any potential sources of water which might leak.\ Considering the weight of the servers and racks will increase
over time as more equipment is added over the upcoming years, it will be essential to assess the load-bearing capacity
of the floor to ensure it can safely accommodate the anticipated growth.

\subsubsection{Operations Room}
This room will be home to the entire club.\ It will be the place to keep inventory of random parts such as raid cards,
hard drives, warranty documents, hardware projects by the CS team, etc.\ As suggested by the name of the room, it will
also be the place where the sysadmins will administer the servers and thus this room will require around 2--4 computers.
The reason to have two separate rooms instead of sharing a common room is due to the fact that servers are loud and long
term exposure to such noise can cause hearing loss.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Budget}\label{subsec:budget}
With reference to the price list in table~\ref{table:price-list}, a budget of about \textbf{\large3--4 Lakh INR} is
to be expected for the following items:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dell Poweredge R730 (128GB DDR4, 2xE5-2696 v4)
    \item Dell Poweredge R620 (64GB DDR3, 2xE5-2670 v2)
    \item 2x8TB SATA HDD budget upto 36,000 INR
    \item 24/48 port network switch budget upto 20,000 INR
    \item 42u server rack budget upto 50,000 INR
    \item UPS budget upto 60,000 INR
\end{itemize}
\\
This is by no means the final budget, instead it offers a ballpark estimation to allow the reader to make an informed
decision about whether to accept this proposal or not.\ If the proposal is accepted, I can start requesting quotes
from various vendors on behalf of the university both online and offline (Nehru Place market) and prepare a proper
budget.

\section{Sponsorship Program}\label{sec:sponsorships}
A sponsorship program may also be created to partially fund this venture.\ As a reference, hackCBS hackathon held
annually at Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies was able to raise an estimated amount of \$7,900 USD as per
their sponsorship brochure and the sponsor list.\ Our sponsorship programme could be open to both monetary and hardware
donations.
