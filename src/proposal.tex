    \section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
    This proposal requests the establishment of a Computer Science \& Systems Administration Club (CSSAC), an
    exceptionally unique and innovative endeavor, as the existence of such clubs in Indian universities is rare, if not
    non-existent.
    Such a club offers unparalleled learning experiences to members, has practical usefulness to virtually all other
    clubs and has the potential to offer facilities typically only found in the Indian Institutes of Technology and
    various leading universities abroad such as MIT, Stanford and The University of Waterloo.
    All details necessary for the creation of CSSAC are outlined in this proposal, including requirements from the
    university, and it also demonstrates that the author is capable of leading the technical aspects of this initiative.
