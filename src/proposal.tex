    \chapter{Introduction: The What and Why}\label{ch:introduction}

    \section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
    This proposal requests the establishment of a Computer Science \& Systems Administration Club (CSSAC), an
    exceptionally unique and innovative endeavor, as the existence of such clubs in Indian universities is rare, if not
    non-existent.
    Such a club offers unparalleled learning experiences to members, has practical usefulness to virtually all other
    clubs and has the potential to offer facilities typically only found in the Indian Institutes of Technology and
    various leading universities abroad such as MIT, Stanford, University of California and The University of Waterloo.
    \\
    All details necessary for the creation of CSSAC are outlined in this proposal, including requirements from the
    university, and it also demonstrates that the author is capable of leading the technical aspects of this initiative.

    \section{Vision}\label{sec:vision}
    \emph{``What I cannot create, I do not understand.''}{\par\hfill\small{---Richard Feynman}}
    \\\\
    At the very heart of this club is the goal to learn by doing, to obtain in-depth knowledge, to cultivate a community
    of technically competent members who possess a strong theoretical foundation in computer science but also have the
    ability to practically apply that knowledge to real-world problems.\ After all, we're soon to be engineers.
    CSSAC places no emphasis on tasks aimed solely at securing better job prospects, but only on the goal of
    utilizing our time at the university to become better engineers, and yet it'll allow members to distinguish
    themselves from others in a pool of equally talented candidates.\ CSSAC also strives to promote
    \href{https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture}{\color{blue}\underline{hacker culture}} (not to be confused with
    cracker) throughout the university.
    In practical terms, this translates into having two subteams (not necessarily mutually exclusive), as implied by the
    name of the club.\ These subteams will undertake two different sets of problems described in their respective
    sections, a computer science team dealing with mostly abstract problems and the systems administration team applying
    the learnings from the aforementioned team to practical purposes with fruitful outcomes.

    \section{\large Systems Administration Team}\label{sec:systems-administration-team}
    The systems administration team focuses on addressing practical problems.\ It's primary objectives are as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{On-premise Cloud:} The systems administration team will design, establish and maintain an
        on-premise private cloud offering available as a service to members, other clubs, faculty and individual
        students.\ This also lays a foundation for significantly more ambitious projects in the future such as providing
        high-performance computing (HPC) to research projects in the university.
        \item \textbf{Services:} CSSAC will reserve a portion of the resources to deploy services for the
        entire\footnote{Limited to those who register for an account and available capacity.} university.\ This will
        include services like providing cloud storage, source code hosting, mail services and mailing lists, static web
        hosting, etc.\ Initially, we might reserve all resources to deploy services that are available to everyone in
        the university.
    \end{enumerate}
    The exact implementation details are not discussed in this proposal since this will mostly be dictated by the
    hardware provided to the club.

    \subsection[Symbiotic Relationship with Other Clubs]{Symbiotic Relationship \\ with Other Clubs}
    \label{subsec:symbiotic-relationship-with-other-clubs}
    This club has the potential to offer significant utility to other clubs and offer them the opportunity to develop
    various innovative projects in collaboration such that these projects are mutually beneficial to all parties
    involved.\ Several such scenarios are described in the following sections:

    \subsubsection{IoSC, GDSC, SDC, ACM and IEEE}
    Many clubs in our university have various teams, for example, IoSC has teams such as the software development team
    (i3), IoT and cloud team (i7) and AI development team (i9), all of which stand to gain immense benefits from the
    compute services offered by CSSAC.\ We could also offer GPU compute services in the future to be able to train
    machine learning models and other applications which heavily benefit from GPU compute.
    \\
    CSSAC also stands to benefit from these clubs; for example, instead of creating our own web development team we
    could offload such tasks to the web development teams of these clubs\@.

    \subsubsection{Karuyantra Club}
    The Karuyantra club could offer us 3D printing services to be able to produce various makeshift solutions in an
    example scenario such as when a network card's bracket will not fit the chassis of the server.\ They can also
    work on a project to develop a robot which can remotely perform tasks in a data center that would normally require a
    human's physical presence such as replacing faulty hard drives or periodic reapplication of thermal paste on CPUs.

    %------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
    \subsection{Proof of Concept}\label{subsec:proof-of-concept}

    While the idea for the club appears novel, it heavily draws inspiration from clubs that are already established at
    various institutes around the world.

    %------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

    \subsection{Outcomes}\label{subsec:outcomes}
    This section makes an attempt at answering the question \emph{``What does this accomplish?''} to fairly non-technical
    readers, because technical readers might already be familiar with the potential outcomes of such an undertaking.

    \subsubsection{Examples}
    The easiest explanation here would be to just enumerate some examples, and so, here follow some tasks that the
    systems administration team will be concerned with:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Faculty XYZ needs to deploy a static homepage.\ For example, IIT Delhi allows faculty and students to
        deploy an homepage under the following URL pattern:
        \href{https://web.iitd.ac.in/~name}{\color{blue}\underline{\url{https://web.iitd.ac.in/~name}}}.
        \item Imagine as a student the university grants you certain services, for example, a certain amount of storage
        accessible from all university computers upon login with your credentials (this also hints towards a central
        authentication server) or even accessible through the internet, a service to publicly host your source code,
        and many other such services will all be operated by the systems administration team.
        \item We might even be able to offer technical counsel to administer the university network, to isolate parts of
        the network from one another, deploy VPN services, implement security best practices, etc.\ I've also noticed an
        issue with the current network wherein I speculate that the the server responsible for issuing addresses to
        devices runs out of said addresses in the allowed range, a student bypassing this server by manually filling in
        their address is granted access to the network and other students are not, we might be able to fix such
        problems.
        \item Many premier institutes often host a mirror for various Linux distributions, such a service often causes
        global appreciation for the university and also benefits students by offering high speed downloads.\ Such a
        service can be maintained by this club given additional storage is provided.
    \end{itemize}

    Having such facilities on-campus, removes the \emph{``magic''} from data-centers and allows members of the
    club to have hands-on experience with the processes that happen behind-the-scenes to establish a data-center.
    This learning opportunity ends up yielding fruitful outcomes for the entire university, it offers compute
    services comparable to AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure and also sets us on a pathway to offer enormous
    amounts of compute often required by research projects.
