# CSSAC Proposal

Proposal for a _Computer Science & Systems Administrations Club_ to the University School of Automation & Robotics. I
might come up with a better name once I'm done writing the proposal.

## Update

I'm no longer pursuing this club idea _for now_ after a talk with the DSW, for reasons such as:

- Room allotment is controlled by PWD and so it's improbable.
- _"We cannot expect students to operate servers."_
- Upcoming mid-semester examination.
